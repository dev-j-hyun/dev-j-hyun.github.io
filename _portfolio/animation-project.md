    - title: "[Scene 1] Hierarchical Modeling and Animation"
      desc: The project demonstrates skinned mesh animation using OpenGL. The object and animation key frame use VQS to store their transform data. The model is animated by key frames and iVQS (incremental VQS interpolation) is used to interpolate between two key frames. VQS has quaternion with translation and uniform scaling factor. It is used because it has no Gimbal lock problem, efficient for concatenations, and allows separate interpolation algorithms. The iVQS approach improves the flaws that VQS are more expensive than matrix transformation.
    - title: "[Scene 2] Motion along a Path"
      desc: The character moves along the path at different speeds and uses the Center of Interest approach for orientation control. The distance-time function S(t) can be derived from the user-defined velocity function V(t) where t is the time between 0 and 1. The current distance is the value obtained by substituting the current time into S(t). Then, the interpolant parameter u can be found using the inverse arc length function; u=Inverse-G(S(t)). The arc length table is generated using adaptive approach. The current position can be obtained by putting u to the interpolated Bezier curve function generated by given control points. The program supports animation blending so that the character's animation varies with its speed.
    - title: "[Scene 3] Inverse Kinematics"
      desc: If the user set the destination to go, the character moves along the path at different speeds and uses the Center of Interest approach for orientation control. Once the character arrives at the destination, the character tries to grab a ball by using inverse kinematic algorithm. It calculates how much the link should be rotated in order for the end-effector to be located at the target position using CCD algorithm.
    - title: "[Scene 4] Physically-based Simulation" 
      desc: This project is the cloth simulation to express cloth behavior in a realistic manner by following the fundamental concept of physics. The project uses 50x50 particles for 2x2 sized cloth. The cloth is affect by wind and gravity and avoids the ball.

      desc: Create an engine for rendering objects to implement PBR techniques. Keep the hierarchical structure of the model while loading fbx files using FBXSDK. Create GUI tools to adjust the object and each meshâ€™s material data. Change the texture of the material by dropping image files into the program or dragging and dropping the texture to the material window from the asset window. Add new uniform variables in runtime without rebuilding the project. Edit shader pipeline in runtime. Apply shader effects to objects or a scene, such as the rusted metal effect using Perlin noise, chromatic aberration, and blur effect.
